# Pet Adoption System
An animal shelter adoption system


## Project Requirements
- Store pets with a name, age, vaccination record, and other details
- Allow administrators to create, edit, or delete pets
- Allow users to see a list of available pets, with details about each one

## Loading data to the database
If you want to load the example data to the database and test the system locally, you can load all the info on the *pet_data.csv* file to the *db.sqlite3* by running the command `python manage.py load_pet_data`.
